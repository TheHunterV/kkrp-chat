# How to use? ❓
- Clone this repo
- Add StrayRP-Chat to your resources folder
- Delete default esx_rpchat (Most likely in resources/[esx_addons])
- Go to resources/[cfx-default]/[gameplay] and replace the default 'chat' folder with the one provided
- Restart your server and enjoy?

# Disclaimer ❌
This script is NOT dumped from the official KKRP server. I only made it look like the chat used on KKRP
